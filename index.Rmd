I am a second year Master of Public Health candidate in the Department of Biostatistics at [Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/become-student/departments/biostatistics), with training in Health Economics and Outcome Research. I obtained my B.S. in Biotechnology at the [Sun Yat-Sen Unviersity](http://www.sysu.edu.cn/2012/en/index.htm) in 2018.

I currently work as a data analyst intern at Technical Devision, [United Nations Population Fund](https://www.unfpa.org). I also work as a Teaching Assistant for Quantitative Foundations in Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health.

I'm interested in providing data science solutions in solving healthcare industry problems.
